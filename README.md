<h1 align="left">Hi there! I'm Ojelle Rogero ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h3 align="justify"> Hey there! I'm your typical nerdy gal with a physics and finance background, totally into coding and crunching numbers. Give me a complex algorithm, and I'm in my happy place, totally in the zone! </h3>
<p align="justify">I have been into small projects using Python since 2020 but it's been way looong overdue already. Hopefully to complete some of those this 2024! Coz why not, right?</p>
<p align="justify">I started out as an R&D test engineer, got hooked on data crunching and automationâ€”seriously, it's a lifesaver! Then I dove into finance, worked as a blockchain community manager and later ended up in a top US investment firm where I supported quants with all things about funds and derivatives. Coding just clicked for me, and now I'm all about Data Engineering â€” it's my jam!</p>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently modifying and updating my Automation projects. 
- ðŸŒ± Databricks certified and planning to take Snowflake certifications as well.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data engineering projects! Just reach me via my email or linkedin.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to travel!
