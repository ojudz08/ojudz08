# Hi there! I'm Ojelle Rogero ðŸ‘‹

### Hey there! I'm a nerdy gal with a physics and finance background, totally into coding and crunching numbers. Give me a complex algorithm, and I'm in my happy place, totally in the zone!

Created personal projects using Python since 2020 but it's been way looong overdue already. Hopefully to complete some of those this 2024! Coz why not, right?

I started out as an R&D test engineer, got hooked on data crunching and automationâ€”seriously, it's a lifesaver! Then I dove into finance, worked as a blockchain community manager and later ended up in a top US investment firm where I supported quants with all things about funds and derivatives. Coding just clicked for me, and now I'm all about Data Engineering â€” it's my jam!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently modifying and updating my Automation projects. 
- ðŸŒ± Databricks certified and planning to take Snowflake certifications asw well.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data engineering projects! Just reach me via my email or linkedin.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to travel!
