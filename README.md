# Hi there! I'm Ojelle Rogero ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a python programmer, Data Engineer and Quant in the making!

My name is Oj and I've been doing my personal projects using Python since 2020!

I always think outside the box and think of ways to be more productive and efficient. If you can make your life easier, why not automate right?! ðŸ˜œ

I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and hopefully finish my master's degree! (tbh, this was way loooong overdue haha, but yeah I'll get there). I am a number person and have 4+ years experience data crunching and data analysis. I previously worked as blockchain community manager in a start-up company and worked as specialist in one of the top US investment firms providing technical support to quants.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently modifying my previous parser python scripts. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Scala, Databricks and Snowflake.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data engineering projects! Just reach me via my email or linkedin.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't sit all day, coding, upskilling or reading a lot of stuff. But I also love to travel!
