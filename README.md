      Hey! My name is Oj and I've been a python programmer for almost 2 years.

      If you can make your life easier, why not automate?! I'm a self-starter programmer and always think outside of a box.

I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and hopefully finish my master's degree in Financial Engineering this year. I am a number person and have 4+ years experience data crunching and data analysis. I previously worked as blockchain community manager in a start-up company and worked as specialist in one of the top US investment firms providing technical support to quants.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a web scraping script for my master's thesis to parse news articles on multiple financial websites. 

What I have been doing for these past days?
I do love to figure things out and study topics that I needed for every project I am working on and my thesis script. I had studied multi-threadig/multi-processing and the other time did study APIs.
